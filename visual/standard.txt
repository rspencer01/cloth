All inputs should follow the following format:

line 1   :  Number of frames
line 2   :  Rectangle width
line 3   :  Rectangle height
line 4.. :  Data, space separated.  X then Y for each point

All data should be in the range [-1 , 1]
Any value outside of this range will be considered null, and the point will not be drawn (use this to destroy parts of the cloth)
